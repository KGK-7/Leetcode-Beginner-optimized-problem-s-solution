## This Java program solves the "Two Sum" problem, where we need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. The function returns the indices of those two numbers.

#

# How the Code Works

#

## Use a HashMap:

# A HashMap<Integer, Integer> named MyMap is used to store numbers as keys and their indices as values. This helps in quickly checking if a required number exists in the array.

#

## Iterate through the Array:

# We loop through each element in the array using for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++).

#

## Calculate the Difference:

# We calculate diff = target - nums[i].

# This tells us the number we need to find to make a pair that sums to target.

#

## Check if the Difference Exists:

# We check if diff is already in the HashMap using MyMap.containsKey(diff).

# If found, we return an array with the index of diff and the current index i.

#

## Store the Current Number:

# If diff is not found, we add nums[i] to MyMap with its index: MyMap.put(nums[i], i).

# This ensures that future elements can find this number when needed.

#

## Return Empty Array if No Pair Found:

# If no solution exists, we return new int[]{}.

#

## Time Complexity:

# O(n) → Each element is checked once in a single loop.

#

## Space Complexity:

# O(n) → In the worst case, we store all elements in the HashMap.
